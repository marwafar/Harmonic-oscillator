linear-response.py : compute the linear response function.
propg.py : propagate the wavefunction.
fourier.py: compute the fourier transform for the response function in the time domain 
         and convert it in frequency domain.
fourier-zp.py: employ zero padding before the fourier transform. It helps to have the spectra smooth.

The directory 2D: contains all source file to compute the two-dimensional photon echo spectra (2DES).
